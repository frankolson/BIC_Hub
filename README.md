# BIC Hub
(Because I Can)

---

This is meant as a fun project to see if I could build a social media platform. It should be noted that a  lot of my original influence came from the Socify [source code](https://github.com/scaffeinate/socify).

## Running Locally

Make sure you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) and [Bundler](http://bundler.io)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/frankolson/BIC_Hub.git # or clone your own fork
cd BIC_Hub
bundle
rails db:create db:migrate
rails s
```

The app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
